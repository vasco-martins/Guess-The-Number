# Guess-The-Number

Hello HitHub world! 🌈✌

This is thee game "Guess-The-Number", original name, isn't it?

## What the heck is this? ❓

Well, this is a game where you have two players: one will put a series of 5 numbers and the other will try to guess.
Both will play once (unless you say "sim" when the program asks if you want to play again), and wil have 10 tries to guess the other's sequence.

Good luck warriors!
